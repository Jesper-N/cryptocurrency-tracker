# Cryptocurrency Tracker

A cryptocurrency tracker built with SvelteKit, Svelte, and TypeScript. It uses the CoinMarketCap API to fetch near real-time cryptocurrency data. The UI is similar to the official CoinMarketCap website.

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
